The result of the chi-squared test on campaign spending across states was 0.0. This is less than alpha = 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis and accept that Harris and Trump focus on states differently from each other. 
However when looking this comparison is plotted, it can be seen that their spending habbits aren't completely different. Both candidates spend big in swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Wisonsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, but in Pennslyvania and Nevada there is a huge descrepency discrepancy in spending. In general states receive different numbers of payments from the two candidates, which suggests Harris and Trump don't follow the same strategies. While some states will both receive a lot of attention from both, it's clear they don't prioritize the same states as the other.
