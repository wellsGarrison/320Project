The result of the chi-squared test on campaign spending across states was 0.0. This indicates that Harris' and Trump's spending follow different distributions, i.e. they spend differently from each other in the same state. 
However when looking this comparison is plotted, it can be seen that their spending habbits aren't completely different. Both candidates spend big in swing states like Georgia, Arizona, Wisonsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, but in Pennslyvania and Nevada there is a huge descrepency discrepancy in spending. In general states receive different numbers of payments from the two candidates, which suggests Harris and Trump don't follow the same strategies. While some states will both receive a lot of attention from both, it's clear they don't prioritize the same states as the other.
