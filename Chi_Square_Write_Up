Our Chi-square test results indicate that Trump and Harris have largely similar spending habits in most types of financial transactions, 
but that there are certain areas where the Harris campaign engages in far more frequent spending than the Trump campaign and vice versa.
The Harris campaign also appears to outspend the Trump campaign in areas with frequent financial transactions, since there are a few instances
of Trump's campaign having two to three thousand transactions in areas where Harris' campaign had almost zero while there are a few more instances
of Harris' campaign having three to five thousand transactions or more in areas where Trump's campaign had at most only a thousand transactions.
Without further data, this information could support several possible conclusions, including that Harris' campaign is generally far outspending
Trump's or that Trump's campaign may be engaging in fewer, more costly transactions while Harris' transaction counts are heavily inflated because
individual transaction amounts are quite small. Moreover, we see from the graph comparing number of candidate transactions by state, we can see
that as we might expect the candidates are heavily focusing most of their transactions and spending in specific states: Harris appears to be
focusing many of her campaign transactions on Delaware and especially Pennsylvania, given that Biden claims a sort of home field advantage within
both states and in particular Pennsylvania is a swing state that may make or break either candidates' presidential bids. Likewise, Trump's number of
transactions appears to be highest in more purple states like Ohio and even Texas. Interestingly, Trump's campaign appears to have the most financial
transactions in Virginia and many in Maryland, both of which are solidly blue states. This may be because of the senate races in both states, or perhaps
peculiar campaign funding laws in both states, or even because of a belief within the Trump campaign team that they might be able to flip a state like
Virginia given Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin's recent election and tremendous popularity within the state.
